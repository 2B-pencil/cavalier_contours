# cavalier_contours changelog

All notable changes to the cavalier_contours crate will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added ‚≠ê
* Added CHANGELOG.md file for tracking changes and releases.
* New traits `PlineSource`, `PlineSourceMut`, and `PlineCreation` for sharing methods across
different polyline data views (for example sub views/selections over polylines or direction
inversion).
* `PlineViewData` and `PlineView` types. `PlineView` implements `PlineSource` trait allowing for
flexible views over polyline data to be processed with all the shared behavior/methods.
`PlineViewData` holds the data used to index into an underlying source polyline to form a
`PlineView`.

### Changed üîß
* All Polyline methods have moved to the appropriate trait (`PlineSource`, `PlineSourceMut`, or
`PlineCreation`).
* Slices used in offset and boolean operations now all use new `PlineViewData` and `PlineView`
types.

### Removed üî•
* `Polyline::visit_segments` (use `PlineSource::iter_segments` instead).
* `PolylineSlice` trait and `OpenPlineSlice` type (covered by new view types and polyline traits).
